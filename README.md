Falcon OS - A Simulated Operating System

## 📌 Overview

This Mini Operating System is a command-line-based simulation of basic operating system functionalities, developed in C++. It includes user authentication, file and directory operations, and administrative utilities such as a task manager and system statistics, built for educational purposes, it demonstrates features like multilevel queue scheduling, process synchronization, and shared memory management, all within a lightweight, terminal-driven environment. This project was developed as part of the Operating Systems course at FAST NUCES.
